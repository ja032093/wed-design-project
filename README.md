# wed-design-project

The topic I have chosen for my Digital Media Project is Web Design and the areas I have studied are usable interface and user experience. We live in the Information Age where we are able to instantly communicate with one another anywhere around the world and where information and resources are accessible by the click of a finger i.e. mobile phones, tablets and laptops. We have the ability to do almost anything we want on the world wide web and many businesses and organizations are now opting to operate online as its vastly popular as it’s open 24 hours and can be accessed from anywhere. 
The organization I work for are in need of raising awareness of the work they do and a website gives you a professional way of showing what you do, in 2018 if you do not have a website for your business you are not taken seriously which is why I have decided to create a website for AL AQSA FC.

The aim of my project is to investigate successful usability online, what are the fundamentals that users enjoy when on a website e.g. navigation and user experience and what will keep them coming back. The aim of my digital media project is to create a website which is successful for a community organization that has been established since 2002 who are also a registered charity. Although the organization have been around for many years they only reach a small criterion of audience and that is of the local community, families and friends, they want to expand more nationally around the UK, so they can reach investors and donors. Creating a website is the best way to achieve this as it allows users to see information and all the work the charity are putting into helping the youth in London.
The charity do various work however I am specifically focusing on the sports and recreational work they do and the football club which they are training and developing into becoming a football academy if successful. 


In 2017, 96% of UK internet users aged 25 to 34 years had internet access at home meaning they are regular website users and are familiar with the norms and traditions on the web today and are familiar with the technologies employed.
The audience I’m targeting are both male and female between the ages 18 – 34 years. I am targeting young teens ages 13-16 by creating content for their parents which will interest them into recruiting their children of the right ages. As the website is for a community organisation which is diverse in culture, religion and income I will design it to be inclusive to all those who visit the page. Different languages will be used on the website e.g. Arabic and English for users whose English isn’t their first language.
I plan on targeting audiences who have a background in sports and youth workers as the football clubs owners are a charity organisation who do all kinds of work and gaining interests of youth workers will be beneficial to them. Mainly targeting those in London and South London (Wandsworth) area as they will be the easiest groups of audiences to engage e.g. to come to the local events/fundraisers and community projects etc. however there will be content which also will be specific to those who located around the UK. 

I researched into the relationship between humans and computers to be able to establish a connection and relationship between the two to be able to design a successful website which is interactive and responsive. 
“A central concern of interactive design is to develop interactive products that are useable. By this is generally meant easy to learn, effective to use, and providing and enjoyable user experience. A good place to start thinking about how to design useable interactive products is to compare examples of well-and-poorly-designed ones.” (Rogers, Sharp and Preece, 2011)
“In most behavourial design, function comes first and foremost; what does a product do, what function does it perform? If the item doesn’t do anything of interest, then who cares how well it works? Even if its only function is to look good, it had better succeed.” (Norman, 2006)


The production tools that I have used to design this website is Adobe Dreamweaver which is a website development software for designing web pages and it also features a HTML web and programming editor.  The program is user-friendly and can be used by users of all levels beginners to expert and it has the option to change the interface from standard workspace or developer workspace. 
It has good level of interactive-ness as it allows you to preview your work as you go along so you can view your progress in real-time, and in standard view plane you can view both codes and the current page you are working on.
The hardware I used is my Mac Laptop, Macbook have access to the 3 major internet browsers which means testing web pages on (Safari, Chrome & Opera) will not be an issue.  Safari can also easily connect to an iOS simulator that can then give you the benefit of testing these apps and simulating iPhone and iPad like interfaces.


The overall time frame I have worked out to be the most suitable for creating this website will be 6 months. 2 months research so I can analyse similar products and websites to understanding the main goals and targets of the website I want to create. I then planned how I wanted my website to look like so I researched into wireframes and information architecture to get a clear idea of the skeleton of my website which is similar to drawing a storyboard of the visuals I want to portray. Next is gathering the content I want for my website. I decided to do original interviews of parents and football players and of sessions and trainings with the football club to showcase the teams talent and also I included taking photographs too. All original content I have used in my web pages. Before doing so I had to make sure that rules and relegations were adhered to as filming anyone is against the law so I had a release form drafted to anyone who was in the film to get consent before I put anything online. Under 18s will have their guardians sign this.
After this, the main duration of production took approximaley 3 months to get to the standards right for the website. During this timeframe I developed the website by coding the styles for the index page which is the homepage of the website. Dreamweaver integrates templates with styles already coded with the Bootstrap component which is useful for predesigned web pages. I used a template which is coherent with the right structure I have planned in the beginning of my timeline and one with an interface that is user friendly. I bared in mind the target audience which I am aiming towards and as it is broad I am making it as user friendly as possible. Once the template is selected and the content was ready I imported into the web development program. 
I edited the images and kept them consistent in resolution and size, The multiple pages which I have planned in my site map will have to be linked together to the index to keep navigation straight forward and links to take you back to the homepage from all pages to allow users to navigate around the website easier. I implemented the design interface and UX to keep in tone with the information structure. Iterative testing whilst the production is being designed helped to keep it on track and on-time with my project plan.
Coming to the end of my production I then evaluated the product, testing out once more the quality standards and its responsiveness and interface design. This took the remainder of 1 month from my overall time frame (6 months). I tested my web pages by previewing through the software preview function. I allowed a set group of users to test the website as to receive feedback of what and how I can improve issues with the website. Users I used were people who fitted with my target audience, I took into consideration the problems faced when they used the website and used the evaluation to my benefit. 


The website development consist of 3 main phases to complete. Pre-production, Production and Post-Production. The problems I faced at the initial pre production phase was navigation issues and how to keep it responsive and understandable. The solution I found was to make the navigation conventional i.e. a top bar at the website where users will be able to find it easily as websites traditionally have their navigation bars at the top of the screen. Secondly gathering content such as images and videos were a problem as some material were outdated therefore I had to create my own original material, I used a Nikon D500 to record videos and take images of activities to add to the website.
During the production phase the main issues I found was that the content were of large size and was therefore slowing my website down. It has been known that slow websites that take a while to load tend to lose users as they get frustrated for waiting for a page to load after 3-5 seconds. This is called bounce rate which means the percentage of how long a user stays on a website. How I solved this issue was that I formatted my images to a lower resolution and I compressed them to a jpeg file to reduce size. Another issue faced during production was testing the website as I wanted it to be to a high standard to be able to compete with similar websites however to do this I had to find time with my candidates to be able to get them to analyse my webpage.
At the last stage of post-production nearing the completion of the website the problems which I faced was to be able to make it easier to be found online by searchers and the target audience, I found that search engine optimisation was a method which augments the websites ranking on search engines such as Google and Yahoo. The solution to this was to use meta tags, content description and key words in the web pages HTML.
To boost pages traffic rate, advertising is always the number one choice route to go however as this is a charity-based organisation an effective alternative was to receive income through sponsors and donorations to help fun community work and keep the website running.


To measure the success of my evaluation I interviewed three individuals who matched the criteria of my target audience. I asked them to test my website and to give me feedback on the experience they had when using it.

Abdul:
Age – 25
Profile: Football Coach 
Comments: “The website was good and has lots of great content and information on the club and the work that they do. The website was easy to use and it felt really comfortable”

Samuel:
Age – 18 
Profile – U19 Team player
Comments: “The website is great and has lots of good pictures but I think that more videos of us playing in matches will catch the eyes of football scouts and heavy investors. I used the website on my phone and it was not very easy to use, good, it was responsive to a certain degree however it could have been smoother”

Audrey:
Age: 24
Profile – Youth Worker
Comments: “I like the experience I had as it was really responsive but on my tablet the text was large but if my screen was smaller it may have looked worse. Content was great and it showed me a lot about who is Al Aqsa however I would have liked to be able to leave comments somewhere to leave my comments and leave a good review.”

The main issues which emerged was with the responsiveness of the website, the content wasn’t an issue and the navigation was straightforward however the responsiveness is something I will want to work on. 

My experience in creating a website was that I gained an understanding of human interaction with products, physical objects and also technological. Humans fear something they do not understand or something which is different so my aim was to have a website which kept to traditions and conventions to websites of today and to keep pages consistent with colours and fonts to have a set theme.
What went well in my project was the integration of my content which I took. I believe I could have achieved a better level of responsiveness on smaller devices, this was something which I found difficult as I was designing the website on my laptop which only lets you experience it on desktop size platforms. This will be my main improvement to achieve greater results and user experience.
